# CSE134B_W17

So we managed to validate almost every single html document we wrote. However, we had some outliers:

First of all, the 404.html page generated by Firebase doesn't validate because its img tag is missing an alt attribute. We didn't mess
with this because it was generated by Firebase and because we didn't want to potentially screw anything up.

Second, on our testing html doc (test.html), we were given a warning on using bdi tags since they aren't supported by every browser. We
figured we could leave that in since we needed to test them anyway and because they aren't errors.

Finally, we kept getting an error with the keygen tag. It's considered obsolete by the validator even though it was on spec. We tried to
get rid of the error but didn't manage to do so. So, instead, we just decided to mention it here.

Everything else should be correct.

Thanks,

		<p>Hello, I am an undergraduate student at UCSD. I am studying Computer Science and Engineering. I
		   hope to be graduating at the end of this quarter. I'm also not very proficient in web-based
                   technologies. This class should resolve some of those issues, though.</p>	
		<p>I was born right here in San Diego, though the hospital I stayed at was torn down a long time ago.
		   I've pretty much stayed in California my entire life, though I've gone overseas to my parents' homeland
		   every now and then. Honestly, I love San Diego. It's nice and I do plan on getting a job here and staying
		   in-city.</p>
		<p>Right now I'm taking <b>CSE134b</b> (obviously), <b>CSE124</b>, and <b>CSE131</b>. CSE124 seems pretty difficult so far because
		   we have to build a network on our own from the ground up, and CSE131 is Compilers which is always a pain in the
		   ass. It's the <i>boogeyman</i> of Computer Science majors.</p>
		<p>All in all, I hope this project goes well for us. Here's a video I found interesting:</p>

		<p>Hi, I am a graduate student from Materials Science. Because I am interested in programming, I took many classes of computer science from last year. The reason why I take <b>CSE134B</b> is that I don't have much experience on front end design. So far, our group design a nice looking interface for our web application and learn to use firebase to host our web page. I believe at the end of this quarter, we will develop a good web application and have an unforgettable experience.</p>

		<p>I was born in Taiwan. I came to the U.S. to pursue my master degree. After one and half years, I've learned many new skills and meet many new friends. I am so lucky that both my team member Ryan and JP are easygoing and always support each others although we all busy taking many classes</p>

		<p>This quarter, I'm taking <b>CSE110</b>, <b>CSE134B</b> and <b>CSE258</b>. Hope that I can survive at the end of quarter :)</p>

			Hi, I am currently attending University of California, San Diego as an undergraduate student. I am a Computer Science & Engineering Major B.S. and this is my last quarter. This is my third web developement class so I have some experience. Having said that, I'm not sure I've learned how to implement HTML "correctly." I hope this class will help me with that.
		</p>	
		<p>
			I was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan and moved to Vista, California when I was about 3 years old. Two years later, I moved to Carlsbad and have lived their ever since. I intend to graduate soon and get a job in either security or web developement. I enjoy tennis, soccer, coding and gaming.
		</p>
		<p>
			This quarter, I'm taking <b>CSE 134B</b>, <b>CSE 170</b>, <b>CSE 131</b> and <b>CSE 107</b>. The latter of the four is cryptography and is most likely my most difficult class. It is math based, but there is also some coding involved. Compilers is also a difficult class, but managable. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Moving forward, I'm excited to learn a lot about the correct methods to web developement. The following is a video I though was funny:
